!!! and now cubic plus PK3C testing together (first run Cubic, then PK3C, and PK3C wins, so if someone starts using PK3C in the world,
then some months later everyone will have to move to PK3C, because it is more aggressive and forces Cubic down):

-- so overall conclusion that PK3C is the same or better for this 50 connections with 107 MBits/sec case.


It is expected that the PK3C should win a lot against cubic for the high-loss-rate connections (since PK3C can detect optimal rate even if level of noise or loss rate is high).
Did testing for such high loss rate connections, but results not included yet inside this testing.txt file.




For kernel3 the results are worse and for PK3C need at least 30 seconds of iperf test for seeing this more or less balanced results (and don't forget to init "tc" and other params before running test with kernel3):
